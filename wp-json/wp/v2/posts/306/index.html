It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser. PWA can be thought of as similar to AJAX or other related models that incorporate a set of application characteristics, including use of specific web technologies and techniques. PWA includes functionality like working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access, enabling creating user experiences similar to native applications on destop and mobile devices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PWAs give us the ability to create web apps that take benefit of both web and native app features. Web apps are more discoverable than native apps, it\u2019s a lot easier and fater to visit a website than to install an application, and you can also share web apps by simply sending a link. On the other hand, native apps are better integrated with the operating system and therefore offer a more seamless experience for the users. You can install a native app so that it works offline, and users can easily access their favorite apps through icons, rather than navigating to it using a browser.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many commonly used technologies to create progressive web apps. To call a Web App a PWA, technically speaking it should have the following features: It must run under&nbsp;Secure contexts&nbsp;(HTTPS), must implement a&nbsp;Service Worker, and a&nbsp;manifest file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The PWA approach is characterized by the following set of attributes:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Responsive<\/li><li>Connectivity independent<\/li><li>App-like interactions<\/li><li>Fresh<\/li><li>Safe<\/li><li>Discoverable<\/li><li>Re-engageable<\/li><li>Installable<\/li><li>Linkable<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of PWA<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cheaper than other apps<\/li><li>Count towards SEO<\/li><li>lower usage threshold<\/li><li>not dependent on app stores<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disadvantages of PWA<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fewer functionalities and therefore less UX<\/li><li>No access to innovations (Such as Bluetooth or NFC)<\/li><li>No extra room for business model&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Progressive_web_apps\">https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Progressive_web_apps<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_web_application\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Progressive_web_application<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@amberleyjohanna\/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093\">https:\/\/medium.com\/@amberleyjohanna\/seriously-though-what-is-a-progressive-web-app-56130600a093<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Progressive Web App (PWA)&nbsp;is application software delivered through the web, uses web browser APIs and features along with progressive enhancement approach to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications.
