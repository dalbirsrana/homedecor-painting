It divides the characteristics of the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model-view-controller pattern suggests three main components to be used in software development:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A&nbsp;<em>Model<\/em>, which describes the underlying logical structure of data in a software application. The model component does not contain any information about the user interface.<\/li><li>A&nbsp;<em>View<\/em>, which explains the elements in the user interface (all of the things the user can see and respond to on the screen, such as buttons, display boxes, and so forth)<\/li><li>A&nbsp;<em>Controller<\/em>, which defines connecting the model and the view, and is used to communicate between characters in the model and view.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>MVC provides very loose coupling between these three layers. MVC patterns provide the facility of parallel development. It means that each layer of the application is independent of each other i.e. different developers can work on the single application simultaneously. One team can work on user input logic (controller logic), and the second team can work on the user interface logic (view) and some others can work on the business logic (model) at the same time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MVC pattern is widely used in development with programming languages such as Java, .NET, PHP. The MVC pattern has been proclaimed by many developers as a useful pattern for the reuse of object code and a model that lets them to significantly decrease the time it takes to produce applications with user interfaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of using MVC framework<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It saves time with faster development process<\/li><li>It enables the user interface to display multiple views of the same data at the same time.<\/li><li>The modification does not affect the entire model: MVC makes it easy to change the view, as every layer is independent.
