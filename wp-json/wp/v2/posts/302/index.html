For example, many websites show reviews and ratings from other third-party website so they use APIs from other application on their website to display their reviews and ratings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>APIs are helpful to developers because they can easily add specific functionality or access data to their application, without rewriting all of the code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, APIs are referred to as web APIs. However, APIs can be two local applications that don\u2019t require a network to communicate with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web service APIs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Web service APIs are small applications that utilize URLs on the internet to provide their services to other web applications. &nbsp;It is a method for two machines to interact with each other over a network. A web-server running on a computer listens to requests from other computers. When a request is received, the web service returns the requested resources, which could an HTML file, JSON or XML type. A Web service is simply an API wrapped in HTTP.&nbsp; A Web service might not include a complete set of specifications and sometimes might not be able to perform all the tasks that may be possible from a complete API.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAll Web Services are APIs, but not all APIs are Web services.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SOAP vs REST APIs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SOAP messaging protocol specifications in terms of the level of security and the approach to send messages are more defined than REST. SOAP grants comprehensive security, built-in ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance and reliable messaging functionality which makes it more suitable for enterprise applications like banking transactions, LDAP interaction and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOAP allows processes running on different operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) to connect and communicate using XML (Extensible Markup Language). The devices don\u2019t need to use the same platforms because they both understand the language of XML.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">REST (Representational State Transfer)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>REST API<\/strong>&nbsp;is a standardized architecture style for creating a Web Service API. REST APIs are based on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier) HTTP protocol and uses different data formats like JSON, HTML, XML and plain text for sending messages, which are super browser-compatible. The usage of simpler data formats makes the payloads lighter which makes REST APIs be more desirable for a wider range of applications. REST APIs are simple to build and scale as opposed to other types of APIs. REST APIs use SSL security which means it can use HTTPS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does stateless mean in REST?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In REST architecture, the server does not store any state of the client session on the server-side. Each request from the client must contain all of the information required to understand by the server. The client is responsible for storing and handling all application state-related information on the client-side. It also means that the client is responsible for sending any state information to the server whenever it is needed. Because, there is not session affinity or sticky sessions on the server the connection is stateless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resources:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.decipherzone.com\/blog-detail\/Types-of-APIs\">https:\/\/www.decipherzone.com\/blog-detail\/Types-of-APIs<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>APIs APIs (Application Programming Interface) is a set of procedures and functions used to create applications that can communicate with the features or data of other applications or an operating system.
