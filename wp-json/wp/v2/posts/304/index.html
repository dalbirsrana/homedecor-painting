Application can divide into individual functions, which can be used and scaled separately. On a serverless architecture, you only focus on standalone functions in the application code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With serverless computing, you get backend services on an as-used basis. Developers can deploy code without bothering about the underlying foundation. Traditional server charges for a set bandwidth or number of servers, whether they are used or not. This results in lots of server space went to waste. On the other hand, serverless computing provides an auto-scaling model, which reduces cost by only charging for the services you use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serverless computing doesn\u2019t mean there is no server, it is the developer who do not need to be aware of it. The term \u2018serverless\u2019 is somewhat misleading, as there are still servers providing these backend services, but all of the server space and infrastructure concerns are handled by the vendor. Serverless means that the developers can do their work without having to worry about servers at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Services serverless computing provides<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Serverless service providers mostly offer database and storage services and many also have Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)&nbsp;platforms. These platforms can execute pieces of code on the edge without storing any data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of serverless computing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lower costs<\/li><li>Simplified scalability<\/li><li>Simplified back-end code<\/li><li>Quicker turnaround<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Serverless Vendors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AWS Lambda<\/li><li>Cloudflare Workers<\/li><li>Google Cloud Functions<\/li><li>IBM Cloud Functions<\/li><li>Microsoft Azure Functions<\/li><li>Oracle Functions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Should Use Serverless?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The serverless model is best if you need a small number of functions to be hosted. Although a complex application can still take benefits. If you have an existing application, it may not be feasible to build all in one go, gradually migrating small pieces of the application into serverless functions makes more sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>References:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/docs\/glossary\/what-is-serverless-architecture\">https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/docs\/glossary\/what-is-serverless-architecture<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/what-is-serverless-architecture-what-are-its-pros-and-cons-cc4b804022e9\">https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/what-is-serverless-architecture-what-are-its-pros-and-cons-cc4b804022e9<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Serverless computing&nbsp;is a&nbsp;cloud computing&nbsp;execution model&nbsp;in which the cloud provider runs the&nbsp;server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources.
