Presently websites have more features than ever before. All this leads to a common problem of performance. Many websites struggle to perform on various devices and networks. The problem can be so worse that sometimes websites are completely inaccessible or do not respond to user inputs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why performance matters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To retain users<\/strong> \u2013 High performing websites engage and retain users much better than non-performing sites. It doesn\u2019t matter how beautiful a site is, for every delay in site load, you lose some users. Performance plays a major role in the success of any online investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To improve conversions<\/strong> \u2013 A high performing website has a positive impact on revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It Improves UX<\/strong> \u2013 Slow sites make a user wait and there\u2019s no user experience to speak of. Waiting time on every user response creates more problems. Even if we have a faster network, mobile devices have limited CPU power and memory. They might perform under if we have no code optimization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance is about cost<\/strong> \u2013 Most of the user access the web on mobile devices through 4G, 3G maybe even 2G networks with limited data plans. Low performing sites can increase user costs which leads to more limited users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to achieve performance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check for the resources you send and receive<\/strong> \u2013 Resources like heavy CSS and JavaScript frameworks are great, but use only if you need them. Such resources create heaps of CSS and JavaScript files, the browser needs to download. If we need any framework, go for a lightweight alternative. Not all websites need to be single-page applications, as they often make extensive use of JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Minify text assets<\/strong> \u2013 minifying JS and CSS makes website smaller and loads faster. It removes white-space, strips comments, combines files and optimizes some common programming patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduce HTTP requests or Migrate to HTTP\/2<\/strong> \u2013 In general, the more HTTP requests your web page makes the slower it will load. Consider using Code splitting in a webpack. This allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Optimize images<\/strong> \u2013 Image optimization is about reducing a image size without sacrificing image quality, which makes web page loads fast. Use new web standard image formats like JPG 2000 and WebP for raster images and SVG for vector images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Serve scaled images with alt attribute<\/strong> \u2013 Image size should be adjusted to match the exact size required for a site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deliver images responsively (srcset attribute)<\/strong> \u2013 we can send different images for devices with different screen sizes and resolutions, that work well on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduce assets such as third-party plugins<\/strong> that make a large number of external requests. Don\u2019t use them unless they are really needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inspect render-blocking resources<\/strong> \u2013 Check for what might be blocking the DOM causing the delay in your page load time. Use defer or async directive to avoid render-blocking JavaScript.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduce latency with a content delivery network (CDN)<\/strong> \u2013 CDN is an interconnected system of computers on the internet that provide web content rapidly to users by duplicating or caching the content on multiple servers and directing the content to users on proximity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caching resources<\/strong> \u2013 The performance of web sites and applications can be significantly improved by reusing previously fetched resources. web caches reduce latency and network traffic. By making use of HTTP caching, web sites become more responsive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hotlink protection<\/strong> \u2013 It allows you to prevent other websites from directly linking to files from your website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To create a website more feature-rich, we push it to do more.
